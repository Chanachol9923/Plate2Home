# Threat model

Assets: plate owners' and finders' **contact details**; the **link between a plate and a person**;
**crop images**; **admin accounts**; **service availability** (free-tier quotas).

Actors: stressed genuine users; **scammers** (advance-fee: "pay the fee and I'll send your
plate"); casual trolls; bots; someone trying to locate a vehicle's owner (stalking); a curious
admin.

| T1  | Info disclosure / fraud   | A scammer enumerates lost plates and messages owners asking for a "fee". | Lost watches never appear in search (D-002).

## Residual risks

- A determined scammer can still create a plausible found post with a photo of a real plate.
  Mitigation relies on user education (the modal), reports and admin review. The terms state
  that the app doesn't verify identities.
- Shared IPs (mobile carrier NAT) make IP-based limits coarse. Turnstile is the primary bot
  control.
